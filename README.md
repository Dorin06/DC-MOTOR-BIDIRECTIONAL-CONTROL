A bidirectional DC motor control using Arduino in embedded systems typically involves the use of an H-bridge motor driver (such as L298N or L293D) to allow the motor to spin in both directions. By manipulating the input signals to the H-bridge, the Arduino can control the direction and speed of the motor using techniques like Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). This setup is often used in robotics and automation projects where precise motor control is required. Examples and code for such projects can be found on GitHub, showcasing real-world implementations.
